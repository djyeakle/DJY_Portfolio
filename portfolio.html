        <p>CMPS 160 - Databases</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This Database course surveys topics in database systems. The course emphasizes the effective use of database systems. Topics include access methods, data models, query languages, database design, query optimization, concurrency control, recovery, security, integrity, client-server architecture, and distributed database systems. Hands-on use will be
                a key part of the course.</li>
            <li>Worked with: MySQLWorkbench</li>
        </ul>

        <p>CMPS 161 - Networking and Security</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This course introduces basic networking and security concepts. It serves as a precursor to the more advanced and
                specialized networking and security courses. Coverage of topics focuses on identifying and understanding the nomenclature
                of hardware and software use in modern networks.</li>
            <li>Worked with: Wireshark</li>
        </ul>

        <p>CMPS 162 - Introduction to Programming</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This course introduces basic programming concepts. Hands on programming will be a key part of the course. The
                course is designed to teach and reinforce basic programming techniques and strategies.</li>
            <li>Worked with: HTMl, JavaScript, CSS, and Visual Studio Code</li>
        </ul>

        <p>CMPS 163 - Business Analytics</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This course will provide you with concepts and tools to utilize data for making informed business decisions. We will
                start with the raw data and work our way to conclusions and examine all the intermediate steps in detail. Topics such as
                data collection, model selection, built-in assumptions, and uncertainty will be at the core of the course. You will familiarize
                yourself with tools to apply these concepts in practice.</li>
            <li>Worked with: Excel</li>
        </ul>

        <p>CMPS 260 - Data Structures</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In this course fundamental data structures will be explored that are indispensable when programming. Some major
                areas are objects, lists, arrays, stacks, queues, and more. Tradeoffs in terms of computational complexity and operations on
                these data structures are also discussed.</li>
            <li>Worked with: Visual Studio Code</li>
        </ul>

        <p>CMPS 261 - Server Management</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In this course, students will learn how to administer a server. This ranges from installing an operating system, remotely
                installing software packages through a package manager, configuring the system, managing security and encryption, backups, to shell scripting. A big component of this course is lab work. </li>
            <li>Worked with: UTM, FreeBSD, Unix, and Terminal</li>
        </ul>

        <p>CMPS 262 - Advanced Programming</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This course continues where CMPS 162 and CMPS 260 leave off. The focus will be on problem solving but with a
                much higher difficulty level. The students will be required to write programs that involve multiple units of organization,
                e.g., classes. Several advanced algorithms will be discussed and should be implemented by the students.</li>
            <li>Worked with: HTML, JavaScript, CSS, TypeScript, Bootstrap, Visual Studio Code, Netlify, Postman, PostgreSQL, PgAdmin4, and Render</li>
