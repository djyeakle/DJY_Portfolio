        <ul>
            <li>This course introduces basic networking and security concepts. It serves as a precursor to the more advanced and
                specialized networking and security courses. Coverage of topics focuses on identifying and understanding the nomenclature
                of hardware and software use in modern networks.</li>
            <li>Worked with: Wireshark</li>
        </ul>

        <p>CMPS 162 - Introduction to Programming</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This course introduces basic programming concepts. Hands on programming will be a key part of the course. The
                course is designed to teach and reinforce basic programming techniques and strategies.</li>
            <li>Worked with: HTMl, JavaScript, CSS, and Visual Studio Code</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>CMPS 163 - Business Analytics</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This course will provide you with concepts and tools to utilize data for making informed business decisions. We will
                start with the raw data and work our way to conclusions and examine all the intermediate steps in detail. Topics such as
                data collection, model selection, built-in assumptions, and uncertainty will be at the core of the course. You will familiarize
                yourself with tools to apply these concepts in practice.</li>
            <li>Worked with: Excel</li>
        </ul>

        <p>CMPS 260 - Data Structures</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In this course fundamental data structures will be explored that are indispensable when programming. Some major
                areas are objects, lists, arrays, stacks, queues, and more. Tradeoffs in terms of computational complexity and operations on
                these data structures are also discussed.</li>
            <li>Worked with: Visual Studio Code</li>
        </ul>

                much higher difficulty level. The students will be required to write programs that involve multiple units of organization,
                e.g., classes. Several advanced algorithms will be discussed and should be implemented by the students.</li>
            <li>Worked with: HTML, JavaScript, CSS, TypeScript, Bootstrap, Visual Studio Code, Netlify, Postman, PostgreSQL, PgAdmin4, and Render</li>
        </ul>
